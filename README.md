## Project Description

Welcome to the wonderful world of **automated testing**, specifically **unit testing**. Whether this is immediately clear to you or not, you have already familiarized yourselves with this process, only, the tests have been written for you beforehand.

Now we start on the other side of the fence, where you have no tests, only working code. The goal of this sprint is to get you familiar with writing unit tests for JavaScript code.

### Initialize Project

- Use `npm` to install the necessary dependencies from the `package.json` file.
- To run your tests run the command `npm test`.
- Get started by implementing the tests inside the `basic-javascript` directory then move onto `advanced-javascript` when you're done.

### Write Tests

Write tests inside the files ending on `.spec.js` that check the code in the files that are imported into each spec file.

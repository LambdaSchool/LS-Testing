// we've gone ahead and gotten a start here for you,
// except, for some reason, none of our current assertions are working.
// first step is to make sure all these assertions work.
// then make sure you have at least 2-3 more assertions for every function.
// hint 1. - you need to pass data to the functions and get expected output.
// hint 2. - you should test the data type being called back, and perform some sort of operation on the data.

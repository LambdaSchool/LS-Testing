getBiggest 
x and y makes me believe anything can be entered in. 
num or str would limit it. therefore it has to be 
treated differently. 
If its a num this is easy  2 > 4 
if its a string a bit trickery 
"2" < "12" is false  because it works off 
alphabetical order. 
need to try to convert it to a number
however what if it is not convertable?
"2"  > "john"  === false 
a conversion needs to be done.  
What if there is two arrays.   
[1,2,3,4] [1,2,3] what makes the other bigger? 
well since there aren't any direct rules to follow 
I would say the length of the array or object would 
make it bigger.  
{a:3, b:4, c:6}   {d: 10, e:12, f:13, g:15}
I will use the lengh I believe for these. 
For these reasons   this function should be handled 
  1. check if NaN  
  2. check  if an array 
  3 check if object after it has been figured out
  it is not an array
  4. check if it is a string. 
  check if the string can be converted to a number 
  5. 

  greeting 
  I don't see many issues either you enter in a 
  correct language or you don't. 
  the only thing i can see become a problem is the case 
  'German' !== "german"
  most simple way is to change the actual case to lowercase
  then do a check on the lowercase version of what 
  a user may enter in. 

  isTenOrFive  
  the function is Number should solve any issues. 

  isInRange  
  the function is number should solve any issues 

  isInteger 
  the function isNumber should solve any issues  

  fizzBuzz 
  combination of isNumber and anyZeros should 
  solve any issues. 

  isPrime  
  isNumber should get this done.
